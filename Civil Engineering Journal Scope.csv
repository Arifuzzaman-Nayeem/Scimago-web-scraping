12,Transportation,"      In our first issue, published in 1972, we explained that this Journal is intended to promote the free and vigorous exchange of ideas and experience among the worldwide community actively concerned with transportation policy, planning and practice. That continues to be our mission, with a clear focus on topics concerned with research and practice in transportation policy and planning, around the world.These four words, policy and planning, research and practice are our key words.

72,Cartography and Geographic Information Science,"      Articles must build on previous research and demonstrate for instance why a ‘good’ new map is a better map than the established practice, basing the evaluation on some form of user testing. Or, how results of a new algorithm to calculate some property are improved in some quantifiable or conclusive manner. Historical papers are considered if original sources are presented and are not just reminiscences or indirect observations. Other articles may apply mathematical analysis for projections and other spatial properties. The mathematics and analysis must be rigorous and logically presented, with attention to reproducibility. In support of reproducibility for all kinds of work, the journal requires that data and software used in the analysis be deposited in a repository that complies with the Open + FAIR policies of the COPDESS consortium.Of course, the most innovative articles may have no precedent, but then they must fully prove their point with careful scholarship about the nature of the innovation. The field of geographic information science is broad. The Journal focuses on the analytical output of a geographic information system, rather than its source material.

Such interactions necessarily need to be analyzed from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes both social and technical measures. For decision makers, the risk presents the challenge of managing known hazards, but unknown consequences in time of occurrence, scale of impact, and level of disruption in actual communities with limited resources. The journal is dedicated to bringing together the physical, social, and behavioral sciences; engineering; and the regulatory and policy environments to provide a forum for cutting edge, holistic, and cross-disciplinary approaches to anticipating risk, loss, and cost reduction from natural hazards. The journal welcomes rigorous research on the intersection between social and technical systems that advances concepts of resilience within lifeline and infrastructure systems and the organizations that manage them for all hazards. It offers a professional forum for researchers and practitioners working together to publish the results of truly interdisciplinary and partnered approaches to the anticipation of risk, loss reduction, and community resilience. Engineering topics covered include the characterization of hazard forces and the planning, design, construction, maintenance, performance, and use of structures in the physical environment. Social and behavioral sciences topics include analysis of the impact of hazards on communities and the organizations that seek to mitigate and manage response to hazards.         "

Scientific advances and innovative technologies in Architecture, Engineering, Construction are key factors in this process, the tenets of which can help the countries move towards developing smarter, and more sustainable communities. In this respect, the nine pillars supporting Industry 4.0 are widely accepted by the research and practice communities to include: the integration of Virtual/Augmented / Mixed Reality (XR=VR/AR/MR); where mainstream Building Information Management in particular is seen as a vehicle for addressing such issues as industry fragmentation, value-driven solutions, decision making, client engagement, and design/process flow to name but a few. Advanced Simulation, Computer Vision, Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Linked Data all provide immense opportunities for dealing with these challenges; more importantly perhaps, provide real tangible (evidenced-based) innovative solutions that until now, have never been possible before. These technologies are perceived as the ‘true’ enablers of future practice. Exemplars from other industries such as automotive, aerospace and oil and gas have provided showcase solutions using advanced technologies. However, until only relatively recently, AEC has only just started to recognise terms such as “golden key” and “golden thread” as part of BIM processes and workflows.        "

265,Teknik Dergi/Technical Journal of Turkish Chamber of Civil Engineers,"      The scope of Teknik Dergi is naturally confined with the subjects falling in the area of civil engineering. However, the area of civil engineering has recently been significantly enlarged, even the definition of civil engineering has somewhat changed.Half a century ago, engineering was simply defined as “the art of using and converting the natural resources for the benefit of the mankind”. Today, the same objective is expected to be realised (i) by complying with the desire and expectations of the people concerned and (ii) without wasting the resources and within the sustainability principles. This change has required an interaction between engineering and social and administrative sciences. Some subjects at the borderline between civil engineering and social and administrative sciences have consequently been included in the area of civil engineering.Teknik Dergi defines its scope in line with this understanding. However, it requires the papers falling in the borderline to have a significant component of civil engineering.         "

Theoretical, experimental and practice-oriented papers on various topics, such as those mentioned above, are welcomed. Review papers are also invited. Occasionally, special issues containing papers presented at international conferences and other scientific meetings may be published.        "
273,Journal of Structural Engineering (Madras),"      The Journal of Structural Engineering (JOSE) is an open forum on structural engineering / mechanicsand papers relating to the field are welcome. Authors may kindly ensure that the papers haveadvanced scholarly value or interest to structural engineers, academicians, researchers and practicingengineers and contains original contributions leading to the advancement of knowledge in structuralengineering/ mechanics. The paper may be an original review of past practice, probe a new field ofstructural engineering activity, or report on results of research and development activities. It may be athought-provoking study that contributes to the planning, analysis, tests and experiments (in thelaboratory or on the field), design, construction, and maintenance, health monitoring, repair/retrofit ofstructural components/system. Only such papers that have not been published or offered forpublication elsewhere are considered. The subject can also include field experience of practicing engineers who have carried out cost-effective, novel/innovative schemes to achieve the objectives of the project that has safety and reliability as a component.
